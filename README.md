This is a SDK to create a  login system on php, which will save a lot of time while creating a good page of php. Later I will give some example for you about how to use this SDK after I think it is esay to use.
###How to keep login
There are two ways to know the user is logged in 
loginStatus()
loginSecure()
which is different in the way the varify the login, first function is checking the SESSION, the second will check in the Database wich will cost more on the performance.
